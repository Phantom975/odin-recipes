        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pot roast is probably the simplest meal out there and it works for a family dinner or a large gathering.
            Roasts will get incredibly tender if left long enough in a slow cooker, so make sure to start it early
            in the day. You can use whatever vegetables you feel like or have on hand so experiment away and share
            what you come up with. Above all the best part about roasts is how well leftovers keep, which gives you
            easy meals or lunches throughout the week.
