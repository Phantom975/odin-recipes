        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pot roast is probably the simplest meal out there and it works for a family dinner or a large gathering.
            Roasts will get incredibly tender if left long enough in a slow cooker, so make sure to start it early
            in the day. You can use whatever vegetables you feel like or have on hand so experiment away and share
            what you come up with. Above all the best part about roasts is how well leftovers keep, which gives you
            easy meals or lunches throughout the week.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>

                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

                <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>8 oz sliced mushrooms</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
                <li>2 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>3 medium carrots, cut into chunks</li>
                <li>2 stalks celery, cut into chunks</li>
                <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
                <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Season both sides of the roast with salt and pepper. Sprinkle top of roast with
                    1 tbsp of flour. Shake off excess.
                </li>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear roast until well-browned,
                    5 to 6 minutes per side. Remove roast and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium. Melt butter in skillet; cook and stir mushrooms in butter until
                    tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in onion; cook until onions are translucent and brown, about
                    5 minutes. Add garlic; stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>Stir in remaining 1 1/2 tbsp of flour; cook and stir for about 1 minute. Add tomato paste
                    and cook for another minute. Slowly add chicken broth while stirring; return to simmer. 
                    Remove skillet from heat.
                </li>
                <li>Place carrots and celery in slow cooker. Place roast over vegetables and pour in any
                    accumulated juices. Add thyme rosemary. Pour onion and mushroom mixture over the top 
                    of roast.
                </li>
                <li>Cover and cook on high for 5 to 6 hours.</li>
                <li>Skim off any fat from surface and remove bones. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
