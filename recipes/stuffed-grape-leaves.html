    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Stuffed grape leaves also known as dolmas or dolmades, are one of the most iconic Mediterranean dishes.
        In this particular recipe we are going to be stuffing our grape leaves with a ground beef and rice mixture.
        To add to the flavor we will be adding allspice and cumin, some staple spices for any kitchen. Then to finish
        things off we will be adding fresh parsley, dill, and mint. They will then be cooked in a lemony broth.
        Stuffed grape leaves are a great way to get people together in the kitchen to cook and eat.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 16-oz. jar of grape leaves in brine</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of short grained rice, soaked in water for 15 minutes then drained</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>12 oz lean ground beef</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp allspice</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 cup <strong>each</strong> chopped fresh parsley, mint, and dill</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tomatoes sliced in rounds</li>
            <li>about 4 cups of low-sodium chicken broth or water</li>
            <li>juice of 2 lemons</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the leaves</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If you are using jarred grape leaves remove them from the jar and rinse the leaves, then you
                can discard the brine. Rinse the leaves well and leave in a colander to drain. (Later on we
                will remove the stems.)(See notes if you are using fresh grape leaves.)
            </li>
            
        </ol>
