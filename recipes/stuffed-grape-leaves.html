    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Stuffed grape leaves also known as dolmas or dolmades, are one of the most iconic Mediterranean dishes.
        In this particular recipe we are going to be stuffing our grape leaves with a ground beef and rice mixture.
        To add to the flavor we will be adding allspice and cumin, some staple spices for any kitchen. Then to finish
        things off we will be adding fresh parsley, dill, and mint. They will then be cooked in a lemony broth.
        Stuffed grape leaves are a great way to get people together in the kitchen to cook and eat.
